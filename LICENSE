-GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-
-Version 2.1, February 1999
-
-Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  51 Franklin Street,
-Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and
-distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
-allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the
-successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
-number 2.1.] Preamble
-
-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
-and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
-software is free for all its users.
-
-This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
-designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
-Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
-suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
-General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
-based on the explanations below.
-
-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
-Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
-to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
-wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can
-change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
-informed that you can do these things.
-
-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
-to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
-restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
-copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
-fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other
-code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
-recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
-to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
-know their rights.
-
-We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
-and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
-warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
-and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
-original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
-by problems that might be introduced by others.
-
-Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
-program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
-users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
-holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of
-the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
-license.
-
-Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
-General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
-applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
-ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
-order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
-
-When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
-library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
-derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
-therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
-of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
-linking other code with the library.
-
-We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
-to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
-provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
-non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
-General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
-advantages in certain special circumstances.
-
-For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
-widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
-standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
-library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
-widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
-limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
-Public License.
-
-In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
-enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
-example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
-more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
-GNU/Linux operating system.
-
-Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
-freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
-Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
-modified version of the Library.
-
-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
-follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
-library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
-from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
-to run.
-
-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
-which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
-party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
-Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
-"you".
-
-A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
-to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
-functions and data) to form executables.
-
-The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
-been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
-the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
-modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
-(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
-"modification".)
-
-"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
-modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
-code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
-files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
-library.
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
-this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using
-the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only
-if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
-of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
-the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
-and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
-with the Library.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
-forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
-these conditions:
-
-a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the
-files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
-and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be
-licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d)
-If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data
-to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as
-an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good
-faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
-function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to
-compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
-the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional:
-if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still
-compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
-sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
-works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
-work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
-the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
-Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
-License.
-
-3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
-instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
-alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
-ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
-a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
-appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
-any other change in these notices.
-
-Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
-the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
-derivative works made from that copy.
-
-This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
-into a program that is not a library.
-
-4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
-1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
-machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
-designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
-the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
-though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
-code.
-
-5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
-designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
-called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
-derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
-License.
-
-However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
-executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
-the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
-therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
-such executables.
-
-When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
-part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
-the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
-especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
-work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
-defined by law.
-
-If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
-and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
-in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
-whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
-code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
-object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
-containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
-directly with the Library itself.
-
-6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
-that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions
-of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided
-that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
-reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
-used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
-must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
-copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
-them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
-Also, you must do one of these things:
-
-a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
-code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which
-must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
-executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
-that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
-modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
-the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
-of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
-the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared
-library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one
-that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's
-computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and
-(2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user
-installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
-version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written
-offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
-specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
-performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by
-offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to
-copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the
-user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already
-sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the "work that
-uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the
-materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally
-distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
-(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
-runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
-
-It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
-other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
-system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
-together in an executable that you distribute.
-
-7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
-side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
-covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
-the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
-library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
-things:
-
-a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
-Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed
-under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the
-combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library,
-and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
-except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
-modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
-automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
-have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
-their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
-or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
-accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
-any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
-copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
-conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
-exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties with this License.
-
-11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
-conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
-of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
-distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
-choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
-consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
-copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
-case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
-this License.
-
-13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
-Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
-similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
-new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
-a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
-you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
-version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
-the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
-version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
-whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
-to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
-Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
-for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
-status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
-reuse of software generally.
-
-NO WARRANTY
-
-15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
-THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
-LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
-PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
-ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
-LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
-INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
